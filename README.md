This repository exists to support iterating on searchfox-enhanced gecko docs.

Long term, all the docs should just live in mozilla-central.

Directory structure:
- `docs/` - The actual documentation hierarchy, imitates mozilla-central's
  hierarchy.  Exists so we can have meta-documentation like this file and
  support scripts that don't get clobbered into the mozilla-central tree.
